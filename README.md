Measurement Operator Trainer is a Python package training measurement operators (MO) for data assimilations purposes. It is specifically designed for the applications where one needs to split large spatio-temporal data into independent partitions, and then train separate ML models for each partition.

Please refer to the [MOtrainer documentation](https://vegewaterdynamics.github.io/motrainer/) for more details.
