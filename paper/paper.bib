  abstract = {A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to estimate the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) C-band microwave normalized backscatter (σ40o), slope (σ′) and curvature (σ″) over France. The Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM) is used to produce land surface variables (LSVs) that are input to the DNN. The DNN is trained to simulate σ40o, σ′ and σ″ from 2007 to 2016. The predictive skill of the DNN is evaluated during an independent validation period from 2017 to 2019. Normalized sensitivity coefficients (NSCs) are computed to study the sensitivity of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs as a function of time and space. Model performance yields a near-zeros bias in σ40o and σ′. The domain-averaged values of ρ are 0.84 and 0.85 for σ40o and σ′, compared to 0.58 for σ″. The domain-averaged unbiased RMSE is 8.6% of the dynamic range for σ40o and 13% for σ′, with land cover having some impact on model performance. NSC results show that the DNN-based model could reproduce the physical response of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs. Results indicated that σ40o is sensitive to surface soil moisture and LAI and that these sensitivities vary with time, and are highly dependent on land cover type. The σ′ was shown to be sensitive to LAI, but also to root zone soil moisture due to the dependence of vegetation water content on soil moisture. The DNN could potentially serve as an observation operator in data assimilation to constrain soil and vegetation water dynamics in LSMs.}

  abstract = {Recent studies showed that machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)) reasonably reproduce passive microwave brightness temperature observations over snow-covered land as measured by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). However, these studies did not explore the sensitivities of the ML algorithms relative to ML inputs in order to determine the behavior and performance of each algorithm. In this current study, normalized sensitivity coefficients are computed to diagnose ML performance as a function of time and space. The results showed that when using the ANN, approximately 20% of locations across North America are relatively sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE). However, more than 65% of locations in the SVM-based brightness temperature (Tb) estimates are sensitive relative to perturbations in SWE at all frequency and polarization combinations explored in this study. Further, the SVM-based results suggest the algorithm is sensitive in both shallow and deep SWE, SWE with and without overlying forest canopy, and during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation seasons. Therefore, these findings suggest that compared with the ANN, the SVM could potentially serve as a more efficient and effective measurement model operator within a Tb data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving SWE estimates across regional- and continental-scales.}
