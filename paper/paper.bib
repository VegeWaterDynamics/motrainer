  abstract = {A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to estimate the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) C-band microwave normalized backscatter (σ40o), slope (σ′) and curvature (σ″) over France. The Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM) is used to produce land surface variables (LSVs) that are input to the DNN. The DNN is trained to simulate σ40o, σ′ and σ″ from 2007 to 2016. The predictive skill of the DNN is evaluated during an independent validation period from 2017 to 2019. Normalized sensitivity coefficients (NSCs) are computed to study the sensitivity of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs as a function of time and space. Model performance yields a near-zeros bias in σ40o and σ′. The domain-averaged values of ρ are 0.84 and 0.85 for σ40o and σ′, compared to 0.58 for σ″. The domain-averaged unbiased RMSE is 8.6% of the dynamic range for σ40o and 13% for σ′, with land cover having some impact on model performance. NSC results show that the DNN-based model could reproduce the physical response of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs. Results indicated that σ40o is sensitive to surface soil moisture and LAI and that these sensitivities vary with time, and are highly dependent on land cover type. The σ′ was shown to be sensitive to LAI, but also to root zone soil moisture due to the dependence of vegetation water content on soil moisture. The DNN could potentially serve as an observation operator in data assimilation to constrain soil and vegetation water dynamics in LSMs.}

  abstract = {Recent studies showed that machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)) reasonably reproduce passive microwave brightness temperature observations over snow-covered land as measured by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). However, these studies did not explore the sensitivities of the ML algorithms relative to ML inputs in order to determine the behavior and performance of each algorithm. In this current study, normalized sensitivity coefficients are computed to diagnose ML performance as a function of time and space. The results showed that when using the ANN, approximately 20% of locations across North America are relatively sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE). However, more than 65% of locations in the SVM-based brightness temperature (Tb) estimates are sensitive relative to perturbations in SWE at all frequency and polarization combinations explored in this study. Further, the SVM-based results suggest the algorithm is sensitive in both shallow and deep SWE, SWE with and without overlying forest canopy, and during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation seasons. Therefore, these findings suggest that compared with the ANN, the SVM could potentially serve as a more efficient and effective measurement model operator within a Tb data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving SWE estimates across regional- and continental-scales.}

abstract = {Although remote sensing data are often plentiful, they do not usually satisfy the users’ needs directly. Data assimilation is required to extract information about geophysical fields of interest from the remote sensing observations and to make the data more accessible to users. Remote sensing may provide, for example, measurements of surface soil moisture, snow water equivalent, snow cover, or land surface (skin) temperature. Data assimilation can then be used to estimate variables that are not directly observed from space but are needed for applications, for instance root zone soil moisture or land surface fluxes. The paper provides a brief introduction to modern data assimilation methods in the Earth sciences, their applications, and pertinent research questions. Our general overview is readily accessible to hydrologic remote sensing scientists. Within the general context of Earth science data assimilation, we point to examples of the assimilation of remotely sensed observations in land surface hydrology.}

TITLE = {LDAS-Monde Sequential Assimilation of Satellite Derived Observations Applied to the Contiguous US: An ERA-5 Driven Reanalysis of the Land Surface Variables},

ABSTRACT = {Land data assimilation system (LDAS)-Monde, an offline land data assimilation system with global capacity, is applied over the CONtiguous US (CONUS) domain to enhance monitoring accuracy for water and energy states and fluxes. LDAS-Monde ingests satellite-derived surface soil moisture (SSM) and leaf area index (LAI) estimates to constrain the interactions between soil, biosphere, and atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM) coupled with the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques) version of the total runoff integrating pathways (CTRIP) continental hydrological system (ISBA-CTRIP). LDAS-Monde is forced by the ERA-5 atmospheric reanalysis from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from 2010 to 2016 leading to a seven-year, quarter degree spatial resolution offline reanalysis of land surface variables (LSVs) over CONUS. The impact of assimilating LAI and SSM into LDAS-Monde is assessed over North America, by comparison to satellite-driven model estimates of land evapotranspiration from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) project, and upscaled ground-based observations of gross primary productivity from the FLUXCOM project. Taking advantage of the relatively dense data networks over CONUS, we have also evaluated the impact of the assimilation against in situ measurements of soil moisture from the USCRN (US Climate Reference Network), together with river discharges from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC). Those data sets highlight the added value of assimilating satellite derived observations compared with an open-loop simulation (i.e., no assimilation). It is shown that LDAS-Monde has the ability not only to monitor land surface variables but also to forecast them, by providing improved initial conditions, which impacts persist through time. LDAS-Monde reanalysis also has the potential to be used to monitor extreme events like agricultural drought. Finally, limitations related to LDAS-Monde and current satellite-derived observations are exposed as well as several insights on how to use alternative datasets to analyze soil moisture and vegetation state.},
