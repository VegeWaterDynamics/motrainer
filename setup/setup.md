# Installation

MOTrainer can be installed from PyPI:

```sh
pip install motrainer
```

or from the source:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:VegeWaterDynamics/motrainer.git
cd motrainer
pip install .
```

Note that Python version `>=3.10` and `<3.12` is required to install MOTrainer.

## Tips

We strongly recommend installing separately from your default Python envrionment. E.g. you can use enviroment manager e.g. [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html) to create separate environment.
